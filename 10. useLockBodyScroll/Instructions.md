The useLockBodyScroll hook temporarily disables scrolling on the document. This can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to restrict scrolling while displaying a modal, a dropdown menu, or any other component that requires the userâ€™s focus. Once the component using useLockBodyScroll is removed from the DOM, the original overflow style should be reapplied, ensuring that the scroll behavior is reverted to its previous state.

For the full documentation, see usehooks.com/uselockbodyscroll.
