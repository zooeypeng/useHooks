The answer can be simplified a bit by using clientX/clientY instead of pageX/pageY, that way we don't have to add window.scrollX/window.scrollY to elementPositionX/Y. Although the tests do not mock clientX/clientY so they are undefined.

Yes, it's really frustrating when the tests are brittle and don't accept correct solutions.

Hey Jan, sorry for the frustration. Since we are running these tests in a sandbox environment its nearly impossible to mock every possible combination. Perhaps in the future we will move to a solution that runs the tests in a real browser for better accuracy, but the goal of these challenges is to solidify the conceptual knowledge from the lesson. That being said, if you run into a flakey test, just let us know and we will do our best to patch the issue asap.
