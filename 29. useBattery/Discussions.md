Why not to set supported and loading already while passing initial state to useState? Something like:

  const [state, setState] = React.useState({
    supported: Boolean(navigator.getBattery),
    loading: Boolean(navigator.getBattery),
    level: null,
    charging: null,
    chargingTime: null,
    dischargingTime: null,
  });
Is it because we are taking into account ssr?

Correct. As a library, you can't assume the environment in which this hook is running has access to navigator. Which is why we check for its existence where it's safe (in useEffect which will only run on the client).
